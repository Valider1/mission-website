      <h2>✍️ Written Testimony</h2>
      <p>
        I know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true Church. I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that He atoned for our sins, and that through Him, we can return to live with our Heavenly Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve felt the Spirit confirm to me through scripture study, prayer, and personal experiences that God knows and loves each of us. I’ve seen His hand guide me throughout my life, especially as I prepared to serve a mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know the Book of Mormon is true and that it brings peace and power into our lives when we read it daily. I’m so excited and humbled to have the opportunity to share this message with the people of the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
